            "I wonder how your 30s would make you feel? Proud, fulfilled, behind, reminiscent or just another year on the calendar. Would they motivate you to drive, go to a shooting range, learn pole dancing and get out of you comfort zone? (Secretly praying of all them to come to pass)" ,
            "Well whatever you decide to do or not to do I would be here to support you cause you know our slogan...we support women‚Äôs rights and women‚Äôs wrongs." ,
            "I don‚Äôt know what the next 365 holds for us but hopefully better than the last 365 did (who knows a paddock pass might be in the horizon) " ,
            "I know no matter what life throws at you, you got it and in case you don‚Äôt I‚Äôd be here to alleviate as much of the burden as I can" ,
            "And in the words of Hozier ‚ÄúYou're too sweet for me‚Äù‚ù§Ô∏è"
